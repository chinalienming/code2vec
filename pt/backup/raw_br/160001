Bug 160001 - VM crash when hitting backspace button on a selected tablerow 
Szenario:
We have a MultiPageEditorTab with textField, combos and tables in it.

Description:
1.) Select a tablerow on in a table.
2.) Push the "Backspace" button on the keyboard.
3.) The VM crashes. See the hs_err_pid6764.log.

We noticed:
1.) This problem occurs not on every Computer where we try to reproduce this crash.
- is not reproduceable on Fujitsu Siemens Notebooks
- it happens sometimes on our Dell Desktop Pc ( see hardware-env in the errorlog )

2.) It is quite a complex MultiPageEditor where we have several nested composites, till finally the widgets ( text, combo, tables ) are added.

3.) We are using formtoolkit
