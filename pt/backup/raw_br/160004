Bug 160004 - Highlighted tabs in main window not updating with other window data. 
When (in Windows XP at any rate) the colour settings for focussed window bars are changed the tabs in the main work area do not work.  To recreate:

1- Use the Control Panel -> Display -> Appearance -> Advanced dialog to alter the colour of the top bar for focussed windows to a garish colour.

2 - Start an instance of Eclipse.

3- Alter the colour using the same procedure to a more reasonable one.

Observe that whilst the top-bar for the Eclipse application a whole has changed colour to reflect the OS defaults the focussed menu bar has not.
