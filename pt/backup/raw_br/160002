Bug 160002 - [content assist] Import statements do not get added automatically 
Create a new class with the Class wizard.  Begin to declare a variable of some type, eg, javax.swing.JFrame.  Let the auto-assist guide you to the final JFrame selection.

When I do this, I am left with, for example, the following:

public class Foo {
    javax.swing.JFrame
}

In previous releases of Eclipse [3.1 series), performing this procedure would yield:

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Foo {
    JFrame
}

This is with a fresh install of 3.2.1.  Changing the following properties seemed to have no effect:
Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Code Assist:Insert single proposals automatically, Add import instead of qualified name.

This has been replicated on Linux and Windows platforms.
