Bug 160070 - PM - Feedback on PM discipline provided
Feedback was provided before release 0.9, but not incorporated yet. 


Just a few, minor emphasis comments..

(1)  Purpose of the Discipline
The purpose of this discipline is to: 
Keep the team focused on continually delivering tested software product for stakeholder evaluation 
Help prioritize the sequence of work 
Help create an effective working environment to maximize team productivity 
Keep stakeholders and the team informed on project progress 
Provide a framework to manage project risk and continually adapt to change 

These are all correct, and reasons to employ the discipline.  However, it does not emphasize a principle objective in the use of the term “management” in “project management” 

Suggest that we include something like: 

To provide leadership and direction in the optimization of the use of staff, funding, and other resources to achieve the goals stated for this work effort

General Comment

The project management discipline exists – also – to collect feedback as to progress against goals / targets / milestones, to analyze that feedback, and to adjust the evolution of the project as it is ongoing.   We should get this point into the overview.
