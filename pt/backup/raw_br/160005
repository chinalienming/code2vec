Bug 160005 - Add protection about misbehaving container initializer 
I20061003

As shown in bug 159989, the PDE container is misbehaving and it is not initializing the container it should initialize. As a consequence, an infinite loop occurs beacause we keep asking the container initialize to initialize the container.
