"RegulaFalsiSolver" failure
The following unit test:  @Test public void testBug() {     final UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {             @Override             public double value(double x) {                 return Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0);             }         };      UnivariateRealSolver solver = new RegulaFalsiSolver();     double root = solver.solve(100, f, 1, 10); }   fails with  illegal state: maximal count (100) exceeded: evaluations   Using "PegasusSolver", the answer is found after 17 evaluations.
