Bugs in Frequency API
I think the existing Frequency API has some bugs in it. The addValue(Object v) method allows one to add a plain Object, but one cannot add anything further to the instance, as the second add fails with IllegalArgumentException. In fact, the problem is with the first call to addValue(Object) which should not allow a plain Object to be added - it should only allow Comparable objects. This could be fixed by checking that the object is Comparable. Similar considerations apply to the getCumFreq(Object) and getCumPct(Object) methods - they will only work with objects that implement Comparable. The getCount(Object) and getPct(Object) methods don't fail when given a non-Comparable object (because the class cast exception is caught), however they just return 0 as if the object was not present:          final Object OBJ = new Object();         f.addValue(OBJ); // This ought to fail, but doesn't, causing the unexpected behaviour below         System.out.println(f.getCount(OBJ)); // 0         System.out.println(f.getPct(OBJ)); // 0.0   Rather than adding extra checks for Comparable, it seems to me that the API would be much improved by using Comparable instead of Object. Also, it should make it easier to implement generics. However, this would cause compilation failures for some programs that pass Object rather than Comparable to the class. These would need recoding, but I think they would continue to run OK against the new API. It would also affect the run-time behaviour slightly, as the first attempt to add a non-Comparable object would fail, rather than the second add of a possibly valid object. But is that a viable program? It can only add one object, and any attempt to get statistics will either return 0 or an Exception, and applying the instanceof fix would also cause it to fail.
