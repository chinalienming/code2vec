Use of ThreadLocals in ToStringStyle and HashCodeBuilder trigger memory leaks in container environments
The thread local in org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringStyle is created but never removed and no API is provided to remove it. If a webapp's use of LANG triggers the loading of this class, a reference chain will be created that will cause a memory leak on web application reload.
