Column-indicating caret is sometimes not in error output
For some reason, the caret doesn't always show up in the output when there are errors.    When test.js looks like this:      >alert(1;      , the output is this:      >java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js  test.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list    1 error(s), 0 warning(s)      However, when test.js looks like this (notice the line break after the semicolon):      >alert(1;  >      , the output is this:      >java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js  test.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list  alert(1;          ^    1 error(s), 0 warning(s)      That's the simplest reproduction of the problem that I could come up with, but I just encountered the problem in a file with ~100 LOC in it. This is the first time I believe I've run into the problem, but when it happens, my error parser fails and it becomes a pain to track down the raw output to find the actual problem.    Tested against r1171, committed 6/10 08:06. The problem is present going back to at least r1000, so this isn't a new issue.
