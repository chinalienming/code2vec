Break in finally block isn't optimized properly
b: try { throw("throw me") } finally { /* fake catcher */ ; break b }; console.log("ok then...")    ... gets optimized into ...      throw"throw me";    ... which is not the same.    The break in the finally block should prevent the exception from being passed on. The expected result is:       console.log("ok then...")    ECMA-262 says:    The production TryStatement : try Block Finally is evaluated as follows:    Let B be the result of evaluating Block.  Let F be the result of evaluating Finally.  If F.type is normal, return B.  Return F.    F.type in this case would be 'break' and not 'normal', so 'break' overrides the 'throw' of B    This is with the build available for download on Feb 28 2013.
