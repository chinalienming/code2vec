goog.isArray doesn't hint compiler
What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.   /**   * @param {*} object   * @return {*}   */  var test = function(object) {    if (goog.isArray(object)) {      /** @type {Array} */ var x = object;      return x;    }  };    2. ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?   ERROR - initializing variable  found   : *  required: (Array|null)      /** @type {Array} */ var x = object;                                   ^  What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?   Closure Compiler (http://code.google.com/closure/compiler)  Version: v20130411-90-g4e19b4e  Built on: 2013/06/03 12:07    Please provide any additional information below.   goog.is* is supposed to help the compiler to check which type we're dealing with.
