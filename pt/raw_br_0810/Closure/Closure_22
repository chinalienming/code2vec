Classify non-rightmost expressions as problematic
Purpose of code changes: When it comes to an expression involving the comma operator, only the  first element of such a sequence is checked for being free of side  effects. If the element is free of side effects, it is classified as  problematic and a warning is issued.    As other non-rightmost elements are not checked for being free of side  effects and therefore cannot be classified as problematic, this leads  to unexpected behavior:    1. foo((1, 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((1, 3)) and a warning is  issued only with regard to the first element.  2. foo((bar(), 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((bar(), 3)) and no  warning is issued.  3. foo(((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 42))) is transformed into foo((1, 4, 42)) and  warnings are issued with regard to the first elements of inner  sequences only.
