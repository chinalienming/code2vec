use @InjectMocks for final fields
I'm trying to upgrade the mockito version that we're using (1.8.5) to a newer version but there is a problem with @InjectMocks which since 1.9.0 doesn't inject into final field anymore.
Were there any reasons for that feature to be removed?
Is there another way to achieve this without polutting our class with useless (outside testing context) constructors / accessors?
Is there a possibility to get that feature back?
